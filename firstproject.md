## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Robinhood is aiming to scale financial services to a generation who is accustomed to accomplishing tasks from their phone. Their advertisement of offering “commission free trading” has resonated with the millennial demographic they are targeting. They way it accomplishes “free trades” is by selling customer order flow, earning interest on margin and charging for premium “Gold” subscription access. As a broker, Robinhood can market your order which is not executed immediately often times because it is marketing the order to HFT firms who are buying the shares for less on a different market exchange or from a different broker and then selling them to you for a risk-free return called spread. Essentially the bid/ask on Robinhood is what you’re paying in “hidden costs” for free trades. That hidden cost is being passed on to the consumer by HFT firms that exploit this market inefficiency.   

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Targeting the younger tech savvy generation who wants to do everything from the comfort of their mobile device. They are disrupting the trend of going online and searching for a brokerage or using a financial advisor whom earns a fee from investing the money you give them. Their chief focus has been how fast can they can meet a customer’s need to execute a trade from starting the app download process to trade execution. The market size is enormous, for comparison Etrade has 392 Billion and Td Ameritrade has 1.2 Trillion in client assets. This market is ripe for disruption and Robinhood has done so well through superior advertising of free trades. 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The efficiency and speed in which customers can deposit money and begin trading is unlike any other brokerage on a mobile app. From app download to invested, it takes approximately 5-10 minutes. This is a powerful advantage they have over other brokerages. Someone who does not own any stocks can become an investor in stocks, crypto assets, or options during a quick commercial break. This behavioral shift in how consumers invest their assets has been crucial to the growth of Robinhood. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Robinhood is using Python, Nginx, Bootstrap, PostGre SQL, Google Analytics and AWS in their software application and data stack. Most importantly Robinhood is using AWS to monitor their data flows and customer bounce rates from their website. 




## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Robinhood is in the online brokerage industry of fintech. Their customers have an interest in financial markets and take their financial future seriously.  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The major shift in this domain have come from ease of access achieved by our smartphones that has enabled trading on your mobile device. Decentralized trading platforms has reduced the costs of paying for financial advice and for executing trades compared to 10-15 years ago. Firms like Betterment offering wholistic solutions to a portfolio charge lower than average fees than UBS advisors (25 bps vs 100 bps). The difference in this shift has been customers trusting themselves for their own financial security, eliminating a broker or an advisor gives each person the ability to choose which products are right for them. This comes with a caveat, that each investor is well versed in markets and financial theory. History shows that the average retail investor is ill equipped for what many call the “Greatest Game in the World”. However, by shifting the power of who makes investment decisions, the major banks and brokerage firms lose some of their pricing power to gauge clients for in house funds which commonly run 125 bps. This industry has seen rampant abuse of financially illiterate clients, who trust their advisors and brokerage firms to protect their financial interests. The trend to stop this abuse began with an effort by Robinhood to increase transparency and reduce trading costs all at the touch of a button. 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Competitors such as TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E Trade and others have shifted a majority of their presence online and onto mobile applications. Their brand recognition spans generations from Boomers to Gen X customers. These platforms are better suited for investors looking for mutual fund strategies and a more in depth look under the hood at the products they are interested in. 





## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The business impact has been notable due to the rapid adoption by millennials and Gen X’s who want to accomplish tasks from their mobile phone. They have reduced transaction fees by an estimated 1 Billion. I’ve mentioned above that free transaction comes in the form of other hidden fees such as delay/slippage. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Companies look at bounce rate of their customers. As each user comes back to the app or deletes the app, that is potentially a lost or gained customer and all their future transactions on their app. Robin hood is holding steady at a bounce rate of 43%. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Robinhood is the fastest growing fintech company in the past 3 years. It has tripled its active users in just under 3 years. This rapid growth has come with a staff now of roughly 40 people and 2 DevOps team members. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

I would suggest they offer behavioral finance video courses on how psychology plays a major role in markets. Topics such as loss aversion and herding come to mind as retail investors crowd into popular trades and often become their own worst enemy.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It would raise the education base of their consumer, would prevent customers from YOLO’ing their entire paychecks and getting a poor experience from investing. Through education their customers' would be better satisfied with their product by protecting their account from their own human bias. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 

This would be a video series and a set of quizzes to help cement the idea.
